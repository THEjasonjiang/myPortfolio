# Data Science Projects Portfolio
 
Welcome to my Data Science Project Repository! Here, you'll encounter a diverse array of projects, each designed to showcase the depth and breadth of my expertise. From data wrangling and exploratory analysis to sophisticated modelling and visualisation, each project is a testament to my commitment to excellence in the world of data.

## Projects
1. [Ashes Cricket Performance Analysis](https://github.com/THEjasonjiang/myPortfolio/tree/main/Ashes%20Cricket%20Performance%20Analysis)

This project employs web scraping and visualisation techniques to analyse the performance of teams and players in the historic and prestigious Ashes cricket series. The Ashes, contested between England and Australia, is one of the oldest and most revered rivalries in international cricket. The project will utilise various data sources, including match statistics, player records, and contextual information, to gain insights into the factors influencing team and player performance.

2. [Password Strength Classifier](https://github.com/THEjasonjiang/myPortfolio/tree/main/Password%20Strength%20Classifier)

The Password Strength Classifier Project aims to develop a robust and accurate model for assessing the security of user-generated passwords. This project seeks to categorise passwords into distinct strength levels, ranging from weak to strong. The project intends to incorporate features such as password length and character diversity to improve the classifier's ability to discern resilient passwords from vulnerable ones, contributing to a more nuanced and reliable assessment of password strength.

3. [Movie Revenue Prediction](https://github.com/THEjasonjiang/myPortfolio/tree/main/Password%20Strength%20Classifier)

The Movie Revenue Prediction Project attempts to leverage advanced predictive modelling techniques to forecast the financial success of upcoming films in the entertainment industry. By analysing historical box office data, genre trends, marketing budgets, and other relevant factors, the project aims to develop a robust algorithm capable of accurately predicting the potential revenue for a given movie.

4. [Traffic Sign Detection](https://github.com/THEjasonjiang/myPortfolio/tree/main/Traffic%20Sign%20Detection)

A Traffic Sign Detection project utilising TensorFlow is designed to enhance road safety by automating the identification and interpretation of traffic signs. Leveraging the power of machine learning, TensorFlow is employed to develop a CNN model capable of recognising various traffic sign categories from images.

5. [Digit Recognition using PyTorch](https://github.com/THEjasonjiang/myPortfolio/tree/main/Digit%20Recognition%20using%20PyTorch)

The Digit Recognition project utilises PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, to tackle the classic problem of recognising handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and deep learning techniques, the model is trained on a vast collection of labeled images to accurately classify digits from 0 to 9.
